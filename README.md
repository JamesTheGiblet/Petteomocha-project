# **Petteomocha Project**  
_A Modern Take on Tamagotchi_

## **Overview**  
Petteomocha is a digital pet experience inspired by the classic Tamagotchi, reimagined with modern programming techniques and interactivity. Designed as a fun and nostalgic project, Petteomocha combines gameplay with technical experimentation to create a virtual pet that responds, evolves, and adapts to user input.

## **Project Origin Story**  
Petteomocha is more than just a digital pet—it marks a significant milestone in my creative and technical journey. Following M.I.L.O, my first interactive program, I wanted to explore something more playful and engaging. The result was Petteomocha, a game designed for my phone that brought to life the nostalgic charm of Tamagotchi, mixed with modern programming techniques.

Creating Petteomocha fueled my curiosity further and became the catalyst for moving beyond software into robotics. It represents the middle ground between purely interactive programs and physical creations, bridging the gap between M.I.L.O and G.I.S.M.O. Each project fed my drive for more, pushing boundaries and unlocking new possibilities.

## **Features**  
- **Virtual Pet Gameplay:** Care for your pet by feeding, playing, and monitoring its stats.  
- **Evolution Mechanic:** Watch your pet grow and evolve based on interactions.  
- **Customizable Design:** Create new pets or adapt the mechanics for unique styles.  
- **Responsive Logic:** Implements reactive behavior depending on user inputs.  
- **Modular Code:** Built for extensibility, allowing easy integration of new features.

## **Technical Architecture**
